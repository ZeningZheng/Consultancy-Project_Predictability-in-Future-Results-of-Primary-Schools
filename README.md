# Consultancy-Project_Predictability-in-Future-Results-of-Primary-Schools

#### Situation
+ The inspectorate of education provided data to look at the differences in learning results of students in primary school. 
+ Identify low quality schools.

#### Aim
+ Predict whether schools will become low quality schools in the future. 
+ Also how far in the future would be predictable and which indicators should be looked at.


The most important questions are:
▪ Are future changes in learning results predictable?
▪ What indicators should they be looking at?
▪ How far in the future can the model predict?

#### Model
▪ Polynomial model containing 3 variables
▪ Linear model containing 4 variables
▪ Polynomial model containing 12 variables
